Analyze this document image and determine if it contains formal mathematical expressions or equations that would appear in a pure mathematics textbook.

Look for FORMAL MATHEMATICAL CONTENT such as:
- Set theory notation (e.g., Ω = {ω : ω ∈ A}, A ∩ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B})
- Mathematical equations with variables and operators (e.g., f(x) = ax² + bx + c)
- Statistical formulas and probability expressions (e.g., P(A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B))
- Calculus expressions (integrals, derivatives, limits)
- Mathematical proofs with formal symbolic notation
- Geometric theorems with mathematical symbols
- Matrix operations and linear algebra expressions
- Mathematical definitions using symbolic notation

IMPORTANT: Only classify as mathematical if you see COMPLETE MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS with operators (=, +, -, *, /, ∫, ∑, etc.) that form evaluatable mathematical statements.

Do NOT classify as significant mathematical content:
- Programming code or software syntax (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Technical specifications with numbers (e.g., "4x10G", "16x10 Gbps", "32064 dimensions")
- System configurations and network settings
- Charts, graphs, or data visualizations (even with mathematical data)
- Mathematical concepts mentioned in regular text without formal notation
- Code parameters, tensor shapes, or software configurations
- Performance metrics, ratios, or technical measurements
- Greek letters or variables mentioned in prose without complete equations
- Statistical terminology discussed in text without formal mathematical expressions
- Programming function calls with numerical arguments
- Data structures or arrays with numbers
- Isolated mathematical symbols (φ₁, ρ₁, θ) used as variable names or identifiers
- Algorithmic notation (Big O notation, O(n), O(log n)) in computer science contexts
- Technical representations (binary codes, hexadecimal values, memory addresses)

Key Decision Criteria:
- Would this mathematical content appear in a pure mathematics textbook?
- Is this formal mathematical notation or just applied/contextual mathematics?
- Are complete mathematical expressions with operators visually displayed, not just referenced?
- Can the mathematical content be evaluated or manipulated as a mathematical statement?

Respond with:
- YES only if formal mathematical expressions/equations with operators are visually displayed
- NO if content is applied mathematics, code, specifications, graphs, or isolated symbols
